INTRODUCTION
============

im4java is a pure-java interface to the ImageMagick
commandline. It is not meant as a replacement for JMagick, but as an addition.


LICENSE
=======

im4java is licensed under the LGPL (see file COPYING.LIB). Since
im4java is a wrapper libary, you should also make sure that you comply
to the individual license-statements of all the tools you use
indirectly through im4java.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

All documentation is now available in HTML and PDF. Point your browser
to doc/index.html. The documentation in the downloaded package usually
is a copy of the documentation available on the im4java-website.

Note that the source-distribution only contains the source for the
documentation (in doc-src/xdocs).

FEEDBACK
========

Any feedback (bug-reports, suggestions, criticism) is welcome. 
Currently, JMagick and im4java share a single mailing-list. You should
register to the jmagick-users mailing-list at jmagick.sourceforge.net.

IMPROVEMENTS
========
Added error control to ImageCommand.java when the error was null
Added setThreshold(double threshold) to set the desired threshold for discerning if the image is sufficiently similar (defaults at 0.008)
Added double getThreshold() to receive the actual threshold value
Added double getComparisonValue() returns the comparison value, the lower it is the more similar the images are.
Added boolean isOverThreshold() returns if the comparison value is over the threshold (images are too different).
